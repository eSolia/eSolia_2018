Print and save this list of important emergency and other useful numbers, for Japan visitors and residents. Share it with your friends! 

A few things to note: 

* Public phones, although a bit anachronistic as of today, can connect you with emergency services for free. Steps: 
  1. Pick up the receiver
  1. (On a Green Phone only, press the red button near the base of the phone. Grey phones don't have this button.)
  1. Dial 110 for Police or 119 for Ambulance or Fire
* Some office phones cannot dial emergency numbers like 110 or 119, especially modern "IP Phone" systems. If you're in an office, ask your colleagues. 
* Japan has a famous system of "koban" police boxes across Japan. You can ask for directions or get help in emergencies.
