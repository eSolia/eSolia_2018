## Your Website Design is Integral to Your Business

**_Or, at least it should be._** When you launch a website, it should actively market to help your business grow, and not just act as a static brochure. The benefits of a well-designed website are enormous, but the primary goal of a site launch is to make a fantastic first impression immediately to visitors, with the perfect tone. Your corporate vision should be built directly in to how the site is designed and assembled, and be apparent to a visitor right away, either directly or subconsciously.

#### On Static versus CMS

eSolia can deploy websites using a Static Site Generator (our preference is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the world's fastest SSG), like the one you are looking at now, or using a CMS such as Wordpress, Drupal or Typo3. Some of the considerations regarding static websites vs CMS-based ones are shown in the following table:

_Aspect_  |Static    | CMS
----------|----------|------
_Performance_    |Best       |Lower
_Security_       |Highest    |Lower
_Infrastructure_       |Simpler    |More Complex
_Backup_     |Easy     |More Difficult
_Data Driven_  |No     |Yes
_Content Update_  |Via Files    |Access Dashboard
_Visual Style_   |Any    |Themes
_Upgrades_    |As You Like   |Continual & Fragile

We discuss this topic at the beginning of any from-scratch project.

#### Need Data for your Static Site? 

If data-driven content is needed for your static site, we use our secure cloud database [PROdb](/prodb) for that purpose, displaying for example lists of people, cases, organizations, contact info, orders and so on. Your security is never weakened by doing this, and it is very easy for you to manage yourself in PROdb. 

### What Will You Get?

Your new Japan site will have these characteristics:

* Professional web design quality that follows global web standards.
* Fluid usability and navigation for visitors, "responsive" to desktop or mobile viewers.
* Pages that are optimized for Search Engines, having the best "SEO" possible.
* Highest quality localization, including for Japan e-commerce, with unparalleled attention to detail.  
* Easy access to any collected data.
