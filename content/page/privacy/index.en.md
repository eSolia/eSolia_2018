To use our secure websites, users complete registration forms, providing their contact information such as name and email address, as well as unique identifiers such as a username and password. 

Users are able to update or correct the personally identifiable information they have provided. If a customer wishes to close their account, a method for removal of such information will be provided or we will remove it manually when that is not possible. 

### Ordering
