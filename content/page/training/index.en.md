## Training is the Best Investment

eSolia delivers training to help our clients maximize their technology investment, increase productivity, reduce support costs and motivate employees.

{{< punchlist title="Booking Process" bgcolor="is-esolia-secondary-1-1">}}
1. Agree requirements, any customization
1. New contract, or, agree scope under existing contract
1. Preparation
1. Training Delivery
1. Training Followup
{{< /punchlist >}}

Although most training courses comprise similar basic elements, not all training is the same. eSolia's training is designed to meet the specific needs of each customer, and is delivered in a flexible manner by experienced trainers and technical professionals.

### eSolia Training Types

eSolia provides the following types of training:

* _New hire orientation_ training for company employees
* _Productivity software_ training for office workers
* _Technical topic_ training for developers and system administrators
* _Localized_ training for your corporate application
* _Ad hoc_ training during projects, for a specific purpose

... in the following sort of training scenarios:  

* Conference room training at your site using your computing environment
* One-to-one consultative training, in person or via remote access
* Training at off-site locations

#### Housekeeping: Preparation & Cancellation

Training requires preparation, which can be performed under your existing master contract, or as a separate project. For fully custom training, preparation can be quite extensive (indeed, it is a project in itself), but for pre-existing training, preparation is relatively quick.

eSolia has a specific cancellation policy for scheduled classes, the gist of which is, the closer to the time of the class, the more is owed in the case of a cancellation.

In both cases, the details will be made clear when discussing the project.

### Success Stories
