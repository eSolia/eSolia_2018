## Introduction

In the case of a large company, a security program is almost surely in place already, so eSolia can act as your "eyes and ears" on the ground in Japan, to audit, and carry out the wishes of HQ IT. A small firm or SME is more likely to need a security program implemented, and that is where we can really help.

## Security Assessment

eSolia can assess and implement a comprehensive or partial security program across a wide range of aspects of daily security.

### eSolia Security Program Focus

The following are eSolia's focus areas for a comprehensive security program:

{{< punchlist title="Assessing Security" bgcolor="is-esolia-blue-2">}}
1. First-pass Overview
1. Review Current Situation
1. Identify Security Gaps
1. Vulnerability Test
1. Document Threats
1. Review Findings & Recommendations
1. Remediate Together to Mitigate Risk
{{< /punchlist >}}

* _Security Administration_ - all the administrative aspects of security, including information security organization, policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities, awareness, change controls.
* _Physical Security_ - access control at your facilities, using imported systems such as Honeywell, or well-regarded domestic systems such as ALSOK or SECOM. Location analysis would be performed to give the best result.
* _Network Security_ - measures for all aspects of the network including device security and patching, vulnerability and penetration testing, firewall and proxy deployment, encryption, security for email, website and voice systems, change control.
* _Hardware Security_ - measures for anti-tampering and anti-theft, maintenance, and change control.
* _Software Security_ - measures for software integrity, copyright and licensing, software maintenance and change control, anti-virus or other safeguards, database security, new system security.
* _Media Security_ - measures for physical storage media (CD, DVD, USB, SD Card etc) and paper documents.
* _Workstation Security_ - measures for computer operating system access controls such as user authentication (local or corporate directory), logging, data access.
* _Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity_ - measures related to ensuring fault-tolerance and redundancy in systems and data, disaster impact analysis, failover and recovery testing.
* _Security Systems_ - implement systems and measures needed to rectify any weak areas, such as password sharing systems, hard disk encryption, or secure file "vault" systems.

## DRP in Disaster-Prone Japan

It's especially important to implement a effective _disaster recovery program_ in disaster-prone Japan, where earthquakes are a common occurrence. Here's how we do it:

1. Identify and agree business risks and key business activities.
1. Design minimum systems (network, servers, office space and equipment, desktops and laptops) to allow continuation of key business activities.
1. Implement project to build out disaster recovery site or sites, acting on client's behalf to negotiate best pricing and SLAs.
1. Perform training and test with business users, identifying problems and gaps.
1. Remediate and re-test.
1. Revisit periodically.

We can't avoid or prevent earthquakes, tidal waves, typhoons or volcanic eruptions, but we can at least reduce their negative impact for your company.
