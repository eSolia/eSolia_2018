**Isn't it Time?** ...that you seriously considered replacing your aging and old-fashioned PBX? If you are in the market for a new Telephone or IP PBX System or have interest in "Voice Over IP" thinking about the benefits of something like Skype or Google Voice, eSolia will implement a modern telephone system for you: a full-featured, IP PBX or Unified Communications system.

Of course, since we opened in 1999, we have run projects to implement the Cisco, Avaya or Nortel systems that our multinational clients require, but there are alternatives out there that will get you up and running on a modern system, with all the desirable features, at a great cost-performance price point.

We will design, source, implement, customize, troubleshoot, and train your firm on the system, as well as maintain it going forward.

### IP Phone System Benefits

Consider a modern IP phone system if:

* you want a system with good cost-performance and ROI.
* you need an implementation team that knows Japan telecomms.
* you desire ease-of-use combined with enterprise level scalability or interoperability.
* you require all the modern features such as voicemail, auto-attendant, follow-me, speed dial, call forwarding, conference bridge, music on hold, call park, as well as advanced features such as unified communications, ACD or IVR.
