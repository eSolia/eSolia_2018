## Project Background

Provision of project management and engineering for a Tokyo data center, upgrading APC Symmetra to the latest Symmetra LX.

Additionally, we took advantage of the opportunity to be allowed by the busy legal professionals to have a full 40-hour time window, to bolster the data center's earthquake proofing, and to remove old equipment and cable, as well as to re-vamp the structured cabling in the racks to gain more space for growth.

This project took a long time to plan, and was a challenge to execute, given the many teams involved - project, construction, electricity, cabling and test.

## Problems

* End of life UPS equipment
* Earthquake resistance could be improved
* General datacenter "entropy" such as old cable, old equipment
* No space in racks
* Labeling could be improved

## Solution

* Implement latest redundant APC Symmetra LX 8Kva with 2-hour runtime
* Bolster earthquake proofing, which necessitates removal of all equipment and racks, and reinstallation of the entire DC.
* Remove old equipment and cable, and rearrange to make space
* Label so that things are easy to find and troubleshoot

## Benefits

* Greatly improved fireproofing and earthquake resistance in DC.
* Space created inside and around racks, removing the need for space for additional new racks.
* Cleanup included numbered patch cables, to allow traceabilty for better troubleshooting.
* Latest APC UPS technology now in place, for a supported and robust solution.
