James Rickard Cogley has been working in the consulting and support industry in Japan, since 1990. He specializes in bilingual (Japanese - English) consulting, project management, and general management, and has focused his career on M&A-related IT migrations and merges, market entry assistance, IT department reorganization and interim turnaround management, cloud technology implementation, standards-based (COBIT, ITIL) governance implementation, and large corporate compliance projects.

Specifically, Cogley has led major projects including Mobil's standard managed environment Japan localization effort; Boston Scientific Japan's IT re-structuring for SAP R/3; project management training development and execution for UBS Japan IT; FEI Company's Japan startup activities and establishment of base IT standards in Japan; Ocular Sciences / CooperVision Japan IT department restructuring, ERP implementation, Distribution Center build-out, SOX compliance, and trading-partner EDI implementation; and Cook Medical's Japan HQ build-out, ERP implementation, Distribution Center implementation, amongst others.

In his youth, Cogley played snaredrum in DCI drum and bugle corps, a challenging summer activity where he and his colleagues learned how intense concentration and teamwork pay off. He was considering his career choices when his Allegheny College adviser gave him an introduction to a professor of pharmaceutics at Tokyo University, and a homestay opportunity made it possible to attend Tokyo U as a research student for one year in 1988. He made the decision to leave research, and his interest in the algorithms used to analyze experimental data was the stepping stone to a career in IT. After learning the ropes as a user and network support engineer, prior to starting eSolia, Cogley was a charter member, co-owner and the CIO of PTS, a professional IT training and IT services firm, which was acquired in 2000 by Datacraft Asia.

Cogley's goal is to develop eSolia into a global consultancy, focused on providing business-focused bilingual-liaison consulting to companies on the most challenging projects.

### Takumi Fukuoka, COO

After several years working in IT, Takumi Fukuoka joined eSolia as a founding member in July 1999, and joined the board as Director in charge of System Support in 2000. He specializes in project management and IT consulting activities, and has led Administration and General Affairs at eSolia since Sept 2006, becoming COO in Sept 2009.

His goal is to have eSolia run as smoothly as possible, to support our growth.
