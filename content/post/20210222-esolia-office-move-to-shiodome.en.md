## We've Moved!
  
Dear Clients, Partners and Colleagues:  
  
eSolia has had a long run in Toranomon — almost 10 years — and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our office had sat largely unused for quite a while. We took the decision to move out of the Sawa Building near Toranomon station, into a modern "shared office", at the Work Styling facility on the 5th floor of Shiodome City Center, at JR Shimbashi.  

Our fixed office there is small, but the big advantage is our professionals can now reserve space for meetings or individual work time, at many locations across the city. That's a big win for our flexibility, and should mean more efficiency in terms of movement.  

Our new address and phone numbers are as follows:  

Shiodome City Center 5F (Work Styling)  
1-5-2 Higashi-Shimbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan, 105-7105  

**Tel:** <a href="tel:+813-4577-3380">03-4577-3380</a> (Main)  
**Tel:** <a href="tel:+813-4577-3388">03-4577-3388</a> (teamITMS)  
**Tel:** <a href="tel:+813-4577-3389">03-4577-3389</a> (Urgent Support)  
**Fax:** 03-4577-3309  

**eSolia Inc.**

Shiodome is our official address as of **February 22nd, 2021**, and we hope for many more years of service to and with you.
