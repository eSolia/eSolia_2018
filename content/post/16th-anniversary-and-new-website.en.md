## Thank you

eSolia turns 16 this 7th July 2015, and we'd like to extend a big thank you for your continual support and patronage since we founded eSolia in 1999. It really has been sweet.

As a leading bilingual IT management provider in Japan, we strive to grow the foundations that support your business, and help you to succeed.

## New Website

Toward the end of this fiscal year, we have been working on a new set of websites, namely [eSolia.com](http://esolia.com) for English content, [eSolia.co.jp](http://esolia.co.jp) for Japanese content, and [eSolia.pro](http://esolia.pro), this site, where we will be hosting our blog post content.

There were a few areas in our sites that were getting old, so we took the opportunity to do an extensive upgrade, to better represent the services we are providing, and to better present our operating values. We'd appreciate it if you'd take a look and give us your opinion.

_Thank you once again_ for helping us reach our "sweet 16" anniversary in business; we are aiming for another decade of success with you, our supporters.
