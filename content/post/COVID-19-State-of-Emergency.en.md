The Gov't of Japan has declared a _state of emergency_ for Tokyo and 7 other prefectures (surrounding, or with cities) as of 19:00 7 April 2020, related to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our thoughts are with our clients, partners and colleagues, and especially with those who have been directly affected in these difficult, terrifying times. 

eSolia is adjusting its operations accordingly to allow us to provide continued support as much as possible given the circumstances. As a rule we are working from home, and observing the Gov't guidelines for sanitation and safety (social-distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, gargling). 

Our clients should continue to use the contact emails and phone numbers specified in their contracts, and let us know any specific policies you may have in effect. Regarding urgent or essential site visits, we are working with clients to provide service while at the same time avoiding crowded and possibly life-threatening transport conditions.  

We appreciate your patience, understanding and support while we all work together to reduce the spread of this virus. Stay safe, one and all.

Sincerely,  
Rick Cogley, CEO and co-RD  
Takumi Fukuoka, COO and co-RD
