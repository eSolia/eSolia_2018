**eSolia turns 20** this 7th July 2019, and we'd like to extend a warm thank you for your continual support and patronage since we founded eSolia in 1999. As a leading bilingual IT management provider in Japan, we strive to help grow the foundations to support your business, for success in Japan.

Over this past year, we focused on building technical and process maturity, working on our project management, cloud database, and website design businesses. It has been a successful year for us, thanks to you. Your challenge is our mandate. We hope you'll continue to rely on eSolia for your project and IT support needs in Japan. 

_Thank you once again_ for helping us reach our 20th anniversary in business; we are aiming for another decade of success with you, our supporters.

Sincerely,  
Team eSolia
