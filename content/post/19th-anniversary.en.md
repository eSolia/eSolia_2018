eSolia turns 19 this 7th July 2017, and we'd like to extend a big thank you for your continual support and patronage since we founded eSolia in 1999. As a leading bilingual IT management provider in Japan, we strive to grow the foundations that support your business, and help you to succeed.

Over the past year, we focused on developing our management team to better focus on building technical and process capability, tuning our project management process, developing our website design business, and launching this new informational website. It has been a successful year for us, thanks to you, and we always remember that our mandate is to solve your challenges and meet your requirements. 

We hope you'll continue to lean on us for your project and IT support needs in Japan.

_Thank you once again_ for helping us reach our 19th anniversary in business; we are aiming for another decade of success with you, our supporters.

Sincerely,  
Team eSolia
