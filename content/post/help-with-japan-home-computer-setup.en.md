## Are you "Fresh off the boat"?

If you're new to Japan and having some trouble with the language and just getting around, why not try eSolia's **Home Computer Setup** service for expats in Japan.

We'll handle the negotiation, sourcing and setup of your home computer system, helping you to navigate the ins and outs of getting an Internet line, a phone line, a wireless network, PC or Mac systems or peripherals, sorted in Japan.

Please have a look at our [eSolia Home Computer Setup](http://esolia.com/japan-expat-home-setup/) service page. You can request more information from there.
