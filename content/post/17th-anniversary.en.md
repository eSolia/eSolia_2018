## Thank you

eSolia turns 17 this 7th July 2016, and we'd like to extend a big thank you for your continual support and patronage since we founded eSolia in 1999. 

As a leading bilingual IT management provider in Japan, we strive to grow the foundations that support your business, and help you to succeed.

Over the past year, we focused on adding value via detailed communication, while further polishing our systems and processes. Our project management system has been in production for over a year, and is proving its worth, helping us run our projects efficiently and moreover, successfully. eSolia has one mandate: your challenges and requirements, so do lean on us for your project and IT needs in Japan.

_Thank you once again_ for helping us reach our 17th anniversary in business; we are aiming for another decade of success with you, our supporters.
