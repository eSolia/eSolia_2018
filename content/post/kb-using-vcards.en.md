## What's a vCard

A vCard is a text file format standard for sharing contact information, allowing people to easily store that information in an Address Book app on a personal computer or mobile device. vCards are stored in ".vcf" (Virtual Contact File) files, and can be attached to emails, linked on websites, or sent via instant messaging or other social media apps. They usually contain name, address, telephone, email, URLs and sometimes logos or photos.

## How to import vCards

You can get an idea of how to use (import) a vCard from the following list, and then try it using [eSolia's vCard](/eSolia-Contacts-vCard.vcf).

**Note** - _If you're an Outlook user,_ be sure to set your preferred encoding for outgoing vCards to "UTF8" before you import. If you don't, the Japanese text contained within our vCard will be garbled. 

* Tools > Options > Mail Format > International Options 
   * Preferred encoding for outgoing vCards - UTF8
