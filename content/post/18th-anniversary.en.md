## Thank you

eSolia turns 18 this 7th July 2017, and we'd like to extend a big thank you for your continual support and patronage since we founded eSolia in 1999. 

As a leading bilingual IT management provider in Japan, we strive to grow the foundations that support your business, and help you to succeed.

Over the past year, we focused on building our staff and restructuring our operations to what we find is a better model. It has been a successful year, adding staff and running projects large and small, while providing the usual on-going support. eSolia has one mandate: your challenges and requirements, so do lean on us for your project and IT needs in Japan.

_Thank you once again_ for helping us reach our 18th anniversary in business; we are aiming for another decade of success with you, our supporters.
